Q1. I would fit my automated tests in the Recipe project development pipeline within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This will automatically check my code everytime its pushed to the branch to make sure its working prooperly. Having to run manual tests is a waste when it can be automated which is faster and more efficient. 

Q.2 No, I would not use end-to-end testing to check if a function is returning the correct output.

Q3.
