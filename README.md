Name: Pankita Tibrewala (worked alone)

Q1. I would fit my automated tests in the Recipe project development pipeline within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This will automatically check my code everytime its pushed to the branch to make sure its working prooperly. Having to run manual tests is a waste when it can be automated which is faster and more efficient. 

Q.2 No, I would not use end-to-end testing to check if a function is returning the correct output.

Q3. No, I would not use unit testing for testing message feature. This is because it intereacts with different users as this feature deals with sending and recieving messages. End-to-end testing would be more suitable as there are more moving parts.

Q4. Yes, I would use unit test to test 'max message length' feature for the messaging application. This is because this feature is its own independent feature and doesn't interact with others.
